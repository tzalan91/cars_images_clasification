# Cars Images Clasification
## Introduction to Transfer Learning
This project include a fast pass through the bases of transfer learning and his application on a real life use of case where we want to train a model which could clasiffy an image in a list of possible categories.

The notebook consists of three simple fases:

  1- Dowloading images from bing engine for each target categories: l_models.
  
  2- Cleaning the images downloaded which couldn't be clasified in the resnet50 aceptable categories: resnet_categories_to_filter.
  
  3- Building a model based on the resnet50 pre-trained model and a fine tuninng using the images downloaded and the target categories.
  
  4- Test the model with the "test" images download and labeling those to see the resulsts.
